# 0x13. Firewall

## Introduction
This project covers the installation of a firewall on a server machine. A firewall is a software used to filter incoming and outgoing traffic through your computer or a network of computers.

For this project, I'll be using ```ufw``` (Uncomplicated FireWall). If you want to try to install a firewall on a machine ***MAKE SURE TO ENABLE THE SSH PORT (22) ONCE INSTALLED, AS IT BLOCKS IT BY DEFAULT. FAILING TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN YOUR MACHINE BECOMING UNACCESSIBLE***.

## Files
- 0-firewall_ABC (Text file): A Simple text file containing the answers to questions regarding the basics of a firewall. I won't write the questions here to avoid cheating.
- 1-block_all_incoming_traffic_but (Text file): A text file containing the commands used to allow access on the HTTP, HTTPS and SSH ports.
