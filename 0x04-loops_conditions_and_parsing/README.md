# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

This directory contains various *bash* scripts that makes usage of loops, conditionals and file parsing. While the general syntax of the loops and conditionals are similar to those of a "normal programming language", the usage of them in *bash* can be slightly akward.

*bash* syntax is kind of similar to Python's.
