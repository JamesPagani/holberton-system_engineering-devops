# 0x14 - MySQL

This project covers the basic installation of MySQL in two servers and setup of a _Master-Slave replication configuration_, which allows one server (_slave_) to copy the data of another server (_master_) in case one of them fails. This configuration also allows to split the read load, increasing the performance of your servers.
