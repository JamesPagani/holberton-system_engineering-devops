# 0x08. Networking basics #1

This project is a continuation of 0x07. Networking basics #0, with more emphasis on the localhost: A special IP address used to represent the current machine you're reading this document on (its 127.0.0.1). It also takes a peek on the "wildcard" of IP addresses, 0.0.0.0, which means (on a local machine context) "any IP address you can find"  and how to configure the network interfaces.
