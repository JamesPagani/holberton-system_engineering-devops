# Web Infrastructure Design

This project covers the bare-bones of designing a web infrastructure. Keep in mind: Due to this being the first steps into designing this kind of thing, most of the concepts will be superficial.

Also, the files contain imgur links to each Web diagram, each being progresively "better" than the last one.
